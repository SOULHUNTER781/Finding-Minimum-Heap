*2.Sujay GS                                           Problem Logic and Debugging the code
*3.Sourabh Santosh Kamble                             Problem Logic and modified code by using command line arguments

##INSTRUCTIONS
*1.After compiling the program.
*2.Enter the elements in random order which is separated by comma through command line arguments.  Eg.  python3 Question4.py  3,5,1,6,7,9,8.
*3.Press the ENTER key to generate required output.

###DETAILS ON EXAMPLE INVOCATION AND OUTPUT
```
INPUT
8,6,11,2,6,1
OUTPUT
2 3 7 7 5 10
```

###CHALLENGES FACED
*1.	Maintaining the initial order after changing and building the min heap.
*2.	Getting the index of the array elements in the min heap.
*3.	Solving problem in O(nlogn) was challenging.

###LEARNT FROM THIS ASSIGNMENT
*1.Using command line arguments in Python
*2.We learnt how to create the min heap.
*3.We learnt how to insert the element into the heap.
*4.We learnt how to use Object  Oriented Programming in Python.

#OPERATION
*1.	Heapify operation
*2.	Building the heap
*3.	Modifying the heap
*4.	Time complexity O(nlogn)
