* 3.Sujay GS              -    1KS18CS103

## Contributions
### Name and Contributions
* 1.Sudhanshu Joshi -          Problem Logic and Coding
* 2.Sujay GS        -          Problem Logic and Debugging the code
* 3.Sourabh Santosh Kamble-    Problem Logic and modified code by using command line arguments

## Instructions
* 1.After compiling the program.
* 2.Enter the elements in random order which is separated by comma through command line arguments.  Eg.  python3 Question4.py  3,5,1,6,7,9,8.
* 3.Press the ENTER key to generate required output.

## Details on Example invocations and output
```
INPUT
8,6,11,2,6,1
OUTPUT
2 3 7 7 5 10
```

## Challenges Faced
* 1.	Maintaining the initial order after changing and building the min heap.
* 2.	Getting the index of the array elements in the min heap.
* 3.	Solving problem in O(nlogn) was challenging.

## Learnt from this Assignment
* 1.Using command line arguments in Python
* 2.We learnt how to create the min heap.
* 3.We learnt how to insert the element into the heap.
* 4.We learnt how to use Object  Oriented Programming in Python.

## Operations
* 1.	Heapify operation
* 2.	Building the heap
* 3.	Modifying the heap
* 4.	Time complexity O(nlogn)
